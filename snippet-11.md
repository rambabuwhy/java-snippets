Explain the Java code line:

```java
ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("File.ser"));
```



#### 1. **FileOutputStream("File.ser")**:

* **Purpose**: This part of the code is creating a `FileOutputStream` object, which is responsible for writing raw bytes to a file.
* **Explanation**:
  * `"File.ser"` is the name of the file to which the data will be written. The `.ser` extension is commonly used to indicate that the file contains serialized Java objects.
  * The `FileOutputStream` class is used when you want to write data to a file on the disk. In this case, it will open the file named `"File.ser"` for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created; if it does exist, it will be overwritten.

#### 2. **new ObjectOutputStream(...)**:

* **Purpose**: The `ObjectOutputStream` is a higher-level stream that is used to serialize Java objects into a stream of bytes, which can then be written to a file, sent over a network, etc.
* **Explanation**:
  * The `ObjectOutputStream` is wrapping around the `FileOutputStream`. This means that the serialized object data will be written to the `FileOutputStream`, which in turn writes it to the file `"File.ser"`.
  * Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, so that the object can be easily saved to a file or sent over a network.

#### 3. **ObjectOutputStream os = ...**:

* **Purpose**: This line is declaring a variable `os` of type `ObjectOutputStream` and assigning it the newly created `ObjectOutputStream` object.
* **Explanation**:
  * `os` is now an instance of `ObjectOutputStream` that you can use to serialize objects to the file `"File.ser"`.
  * For example, you could later call `os.writeObject(someObject);` to serialize an object and write it to the file.

#### Summary:

This line of code sets up the infrastructure to serialize Java objects to a file named `"File.ser"`. The `ObjectOutputStream` takes care of converting objects into a format that can be stored as bytes, while the `FileOutputStream` handles writing those bytes to the file.
